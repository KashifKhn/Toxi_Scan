## Usage

### Authentication

ToxiScan uses NextAuth.js for authentication. Users can sign in using their Google account. The authentication system ensures that only authorized users can access features such as posting replies to YouTube comments.

### Comment Analysis

Users can analyze the sentiment and toxicity of comments from YouTube videos or custom text inputs. The analysis is powered by the Perspective API, which provides scores for various attributes such as toxicity, spam, and more.

### Text Input and File Upload

Users can enter text directly into the application for analysis or upload a `.txt` file. The application will process the text, analyze it using the Perspective API, and display the results.

### Replying to YouTube Comments

ToxiScan allows users to reply to YouTube comments directly from the application. Users can fetch comments from a video, analyze them for toxicity, and then post replies to the selected comments. The replies are sent back to YouTube using the YouTube Data API.
